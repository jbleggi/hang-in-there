# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
This project randomizes classic motivational posters for those in need of a pick-me-up... and offers an "un"-motivational poster section for their cynical friends! Features include a "create your own" page, where users can provide the link to a photo online and enter their own title and quote to display their own motivational (or unmotivational) posters. Users can also save favorite posters to revisit later.

### Learning Goals:
-   Practice reading, understanding, and using existing code
-   Write clean, DRY JavaScript
-   Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP
    -   Manipulate the page after it has loaded by adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
    -   Use array prototype iterator methods to reformat data and display it on the DOM
-   Use CSS and HTML to match styling and layout of provided comps

### Wins + Challenges:
As my first project using Javascript, CSS, and HTML, I am proud of the progress and functionality I was able to create in a few days. Challenges included creating the double-click delete feature in the unmotivational posters section and refactoring to make the Javascript code readable. I enjoyed being able to design and manipulate the styles on the page by using an external style sheet, and was pleased how quickly I was able to pick up CSS styling with this project.
